\minitoc

The first idea of a medium baseline ($\sim$52 km) experiment, was explored in 2008 \cite{zhan_determination_2008} where it was demonstrated that the Neutrino Mass Ordering (NMO) could be determined by a medium baseline experiment if $\sin^2(2\theta_{13}) > 0.005$ without the requirements of accurate knowledge of the reactor antineutrino spectra and the value of $\Delta m_{32}^2$. From this idea, the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO) experiment.

JUNO is a neutrino detection experiment under construction in Guangdong, China, near the city of Kaiping. Its main objectives are the determination of the mass ordering at the 3-4$\sigma$ level in 6 years of data taking and the measurement at the sub-percent precision of the oscillation parameters $\Delta m_{21}^2$, $\sin^2 \theta_{12}$, $\Delta m_{32}^2$ and with less precision $\sin^2\theta_{13}$\cite{an_neutrino_2016}.

\end{figure}

For this JUNO will measure the electronic anti-neutrinos ($\bar{\nu}_e$) flux coming from the nuclear reactors of Taishan, Yangjiang, for a total power of 26.6 GW$_{th}$, and the Daya Bay power plant to a lesser extent. All of those cores are the second-generation pressurized water reactors CPR1000, which is a derivative of Framatome M310. Details about the power plants' characteristics and their expected flux of $\bar{\nu}_e$ can be found in the table \ref{tab:juno:power_plants}.
The distance of 53 km has been specifically chosen to maximize the disappearance probability of the $\bar{\nu}_e$. The data-taking is scheduled to start in early 2025.

\section{Reactor Neutrinos physics in JUNO}

JUNO will try to determine the NMO and to bring at the few per mille level our knowledge of $\Delta m^2_{31}$,  $\Delta m^2_{21}$ and $\sin^2(2\theta_{12})$  via the precision analysis of the spectrum of the visible energy left by reactor antineutrinos in its detector.

\begin{figure}

  \caption{Expected number of neutrinos event per MeV in JUNO after 6 years of data taking. The black curve shows the flux if there is no oscillation. The light grey curve shows the oscillation if only the solar terms are taken into account ($\theta_{12}$, $\Delta m_{21}^2$). The blue and red curves show the spectrum in the case of NO and IO, respectively. The dependency of the oscillation on the different parameters is schematized by the double-sided arrows. We can see the NMO sensitivity by looking at the fine phase shift between the red and the blue curve.}
  \label{fig:juno:juno-spectrum-oscillation}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Antineutrino spectrum measured in JUNO}
\label{sec:juno:nom_precise_measurement}
To some extent, this analysis is equivalent to extracting from this spectrum the oscillation probability \cite{an_neutrino_2016} :
\begin{equation*}
  \label{eq:juno:oscillation_prob}
  P(\bnue \rightarrow \bnue) = 1 - \sin^2 2\theta_{12} c^4_{13} \sin^2 \frac{\Delta m^2_{21}L}{4E} - \sin^2 2\theta_{13} \bigg[ c_{12}^2 \sin^2 \frac{\Delta m_{31}^2 L}{4E} + s^2_{12} \sin^2 \frac{\Delta m_{32}^2 L}{4E} \bigg]
\end{equation*}
Where $s_{ij} = \sin \theta_{ij}$, $c_{ij} = \cos \theta_{ij}$, $E$ is the $\bnue$ energy and $L$ is the baseline.
We can see the sensitivity to the NMO in the dependency to $\Delta m_{32}^2$ and $\Delta m^2_{31}$ causing a phase shift of the spectrum as we can see in the Figure \ref{fig:juno:juno-spectrum-oscillation}.

In practice, a fit to the grey distribution of Figure \ref{fig:juno:spectrum_with_background} will be performed. It is the sum of two components: signal (black) and background (coloured). Reactor antineutrinos are detected by JUNO via Inverse Beta Decays (IBD): $\bar{\nu}_e + p \rightarrow e^{+} + n$.
The energy spectrum under investigation is therefore that of the reconstructed $e^+$ visible energy. The black signal spectrum is, therefore, the sum of the antineutrino differential fluxes from all reactors reaching the detector, weighted by the oscillation probability of Eq \ref{eq:juno:oscillation_prob} and the IBD differential cross section and convoluted with detection effects.
These various ingredients are theoretically modelled in order to provide the probability density function (PDF) to be used in the fit.

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[height=6cm]{images/juno/spectrum_with_background.png}
  \caption{Expected visible energy spectrum measured with the LPMT system with (grey) and without (black) backgrounds. The background amount for about 7\% of the IBD candidate and is mostly localized below 3 MeV \cite{juno_collaboration_sub-percent_2022}}
  \label{fig:juno:spectrum_with_background}
\end{figure}

To reach JUNO's goals, it takes that this experimental spectrum still bears sizeable traces of the very small phase shift mentioned above. Most notably, the
following requirements must be fulfilled :
\begin{enumerate}
  \item An energy resolution of $3\%/\sqrt{E\mathrm{(MeV)}}$ to be able to distinguish the fine structure of the fast oscillation.
  \item An energy scale known at the better than the 1\% level.
  \item A baseline between 40 and 65 km to maximize the $\bar{\nu}_e$ oscillation probability. The optimal baseline would be 58 km and the JUNO baseline is 53 km.
  \item At least $\approx$ 100,000 events.These are the necessary statistics to reach JUNO's canonical sensitivity after 6 years of data taking.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{$\bar{\nu}_e$ flux coming from nuclear power plants}
\label{sec:juno:nu_e_flux}

To get such high measurement precision, it is necessary to have a very good understanding of the source's characteristics. For its NMO and precise measurement studies, JUNO will observe the energy spectrum of neutrinos coming from the nuclear power plants Taishan and Yangjiang's cores, located at 53 km of the detector to maximize the disappearance probability of the $\bar{\nu}_e$.

\begin{table}[ht]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{l c c}
    \hline
    Reactor & Power (GW$_{th}$) & Baseline (km) \\
    \hline
    Taishan    & 9.2  & 52.71 \\
    $~$ Core 1 & 4.6  & 52.77 \\
    $~$ Core 2 & 4.6  & 52.64 \\
    Yangjiang  & 17.4 & 52.46 \\
    $~$ Core 1 & 2.9  & 52.74 \\
    $~$ Core 2 & 2.9  & 52.82 \\
    $~$ Core 3 & 2.9  & 52.41 \\
    $~$ Core 4 & 2.9  & 52.49 \\
    $~$ Core 5 & 2.9  & 52.11 \\
    $~$ Core 6 & 2.9  & 52.19 \\
    Daya Bay   & 17.4 & 215   \\
    Huizhou    & 17.4 & 265   \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Characteristics of the nuclear power plants observed by JUNO.}
  \label{tab:juno:power_plants}
\end{table}

The $\bar{\nu}_e$ coming from reactors are emitted from $\beta$-decay of unstable fission fragments. The Taishan and Yangjiang reactors are Pressurised Water Reactor (PWR) which are the same type as Daya Bay. In those type of reactor more the 99.7 \% and $\bar{\nu}_e$ are produced by the fissions of four fuel isotopes $^{235}$U, $^{238}$U, $^{239}$Pu and $^{241}$Pu. The neutrino flux per fission of each isotope is determined by the inversion of the measured $\beta$ spectra of fission product \cite{hahn_antineutrino_1989, mueller_improved_2011, von_feilitzsch_experimental_1982, schreckenbach_determination_1985, huber_determination_2011} or by calculation using the nuclear databases \cite{vogel_reactor_1981, dwyer_spectral_2015}.

The neutrino flux coming from a reactor at a time $t$ can be predicted using
\begin{equation}
  \phi(E_\nu, t)_r = \frac{W_{th}(t)}{\sum_i f_i(t) e_i} \sum_i f_i(t) S_i(E_\nu)
\end{equation}
where $W_{th}(t)$ is the thermal power of the reactor, $f_i(t)$ is the fraction fission of the $i$th isotope, $e_i$ its thermal energy released in each fission and $S_i(e_\nu)$ the neutrino flux per fission for this isotope.

The latter flux is difficult to predict. To evaluate JUNO's sensitivity and to serve as a starting point in the spectrum PDF, the Huber-Mueller model is used \cite{mueller_improved_2011}, corrected
using Daya Bays data \cite{daya_bay_collaboration_measurement_2016} to account for a $\sim$5\% deficit with respect to models, referred to as the reactor antineutrino anomaly \cite{mention_reactor_2011} and for a discrepancy between models and data in the spectral shape (the so call 5 MeV bump).

In addition to that prediction, a satellite experiment named TAO\cite{juno_collaboration_tao_2020} will be set up near the reactor core Taishan-1 to measure with an energy resolution of 2\% at 1 MeV the neutrino flux coming from the core, more details can be found in Section \ref{sec:juno:tao}. It will help identify unknown fine structures and give more insight into the $\bar{\nu}_e$ flux coming from this reactor.

\subsection{Background spectra}

Considering the close reactor neutrinos flux as the main signal, the signals that are considered as background are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The geoneutrinos producing background in the 0.511 $\sim$ 2.7 MeV region.
  \item The neutrinos that are coming from the other nuclear reactors around Earth.
\end{itemize}
In addition to all those physics signals, non-neutrino signals that would mimic an IBD will also be present. It is composed of:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The signal coming from radioactive decay ($\alpha, ~ \gamma, ~ \beta$) from natural radioactive isotopes in the material of the detector.
  \item Cosmogenic events such as fast neutrons and activated isotopes induced by muons passing through the detector, most notably the spallation on $^{12}$C.
\end{itemize}
All those events represent a non-negligible part of the spectrum as shown in Figure \ref{fig:juno:spectrum_with_background}.


\section{Other physics}

While the design of JUNO is tailored to measure $\bar{\nu}_e$ coming from nuclear reactors, JUNO will be able to detect neutrinos coming from other sources thus allowing for a wide range of physics studies as detailed in the table \ref{tab:juno:signal} and in the following sub-sections.

\begin{table}[ht]
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
    \hline Research & Expected signal & Energy region & Major backgrounds \\
    \hline Reactor antineutrino & 60 IBDs/day & 0-12 MeV  & Radioactivity, cosmic muon \\
    Supernova burst & 5000 IBDs at 10 kpc & 0-80 MeV & Negligible \\
                    & 2300 elastic scattering  & &  \\
    DSNB (w/o PSD) & 2-4 IBDs/year & 10-40 MeV & Atmospheric $\nu$ \\
    Solar neutrino & hundreds per year for $^8$B & 0-16 MeV & Radioactivity \\
    Atmospheric neutrino & hundreds per year & 0.1-100 GeV  & Negligible \\
    Geoneutrino &  $\approx 400$ per year & 0-3 MeV & Reactor $\nu$ \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Detectable neutrino signal in JUNO and the expected signal rates and major background sources}
  \label{tab:juno:signal}
\end{center}
\end{table}


\subsubsection{Geoneutrinos}

Geoneutrinos designate the antineutrinos coming from the decay of long-lived radioactive elements inside the Earth. The 1.8 MeV threshold necessary for the IBD makes it possible to measure geoneutrinos from $^{238}$U and $^{232}$Th decay chains. The studies of geoneutrinos can help refine the Earth crust models but is also necessary to characterise their signal, as they are a background to the mass ordering and oscillations parameters studies.

\subsubsection{Atmospheric neutrinos}

Atmospheric neutrinos are neutrinos originating from the decay of $\pi$ and $K$ particles that are produced in extensive air showers initiated by the interactions of cosmic rays with the Earth's atmosphere. Earth is mostly transparent to neutrinos below the PeV energy, thus JUNO will be able to see neutrinos coming from all directions. Their baseline range is large (15km $\sim$ 13000km), they can have energy between 0.1 GeV and 10 TeV and will contain all neutrino and antineutrino flavours. Their studies are complementary to the reactor antineutrinos and can help refine the constraints on the NMO \cite{an_neutrino_2016}.

\subsubsection{Supernovae burst neutrinos}

Neutrinos are crucial components during all stages of stellar collapse and explosion. Detection of neutrinos coming from core-collapse supernovae will provide us with important pieces of information on the mechanisms at play in those events.
Thanks to its 20 kt sensible volume, JUNO has excellent capabilities to detect all flavours of the $\mathcal{O}$(10 MeV) postshock neutrinos, and using neutrinos of the $\mathcal{O}$(1 MeV) will give information about the pre-supernovae neutrinos. All this information will allow us to disentangle the multiple hydro-dynamic models that are currently used to describe the different stages of core-collapse supernovae.

\subsubsection{Diffuse supernovae neutrinos background}

Core-collapse supernovae in our galaxy are rare events, but they frequently occur throughout the visible Universe sending bursts of neutrinos in the direction of the Earth. All those events contribute to a low background flux of low-energy neutrinos called the Diffuse Supernovae Neutrino Background (DSNB). Its flux and spectrum contain information about the red-shift-dependent supernovae rate, the average supernovae neutrino energy, and the fraction of black-hole formation in core-collapse supernovae. Depending on the DSNB model, we can expect 2-4 IBD events per year in the energy range above the reactor $\bar{\nu}_e$ signal, which is competitive with the current Super-Kamiokande+Gadolinium phase \cite{collaboration_diffuse_2021}.

\subsubsection{Beyond standard model neutrinos interactions}

JUNO will also be able to probe beyond standard model neutrino interactions. After the main physics topics have been accomplished, JUNO could be upgraded to probe for neutrinoless beta decay ($0\nu\beta\beta$). The detection of such an event would give critical information about the nature of neutrinos, whether it's a Majorana or a Dirac particle. JUNO will also be able to probe for neutrinos that would come for the decay or annihilation of Dark Matter inside the sun and neutrinos from putative primordial black holes.
Through the unitary test of the mixing matrix, JUNO will be able to search for light sterile neutrinos.
Thanks to JUNO sensitivity, multiple other exotic research can be performed on neutrinos related beyond standard model interactions.

\subsubsection{Proton decay}

Proton decay is a potential unobserved event where the proton decay by violating the baryon number. This violation is necessary to explain the baryon asymmetry in the universe and is predicted by multiple Grand Unified Theories which unify the strong, weak, and electromagnetic interactions.
Thanks to its large active volume, JUNO will be able to take measurements of the potential proton decay channel $p \rightarrow \bar{\nu}K^+$ \cite{juno_collaboration_juno_2023} thanks to the timing resolution of the SPMT system. Studies show that JUNO should be competitive with the current best limit at $5.9 \times 10^{33}$ years from Super-K. These studies show that JUNO, considering no proton decay events observed, would be able to rule a limit of $9.6 \times 10^{33}$ years at 90 \% C.L.


\section{The JUNO detector}
\label{sec:juno:juno_detector}

The JUNO detector is a scintillator detector buried 693.35 meters under the ground (1800 meters water equivalent). It consists of a Central Detector (CD), a water pool, and a Top Tracker (TT) as shown in Figure \ref{fig:juno:juno-schema}.
The CD is an acrylic vessel containing 20 ktons of Liquid Scintillator (LS). It is supported by a stainless steel structure and is immersed in a water pool that is used as shielding from external radiation and as a Cherenkov detector for the background. The top of the experiment is partially covered by the Top Tracker (TT), a plastic scintillator detector that is used to detect the atmospheric muons background and acts as a veto detector.


The top of the experiment also hosts the LS purification system, a water purification system, and a ventilation system to get rid of the potential radon in the air.
The CD is observed by two systems of Photo-Multipliers Tubes (PMT). They are attached to the steel structure and their electronic readout is submersed near them. A third system of PMT is also installed on the structure but is facing outward of the CD, instrumenting the water to be a Cherenkov detector. The CD and the Cherenkov detector are optically separated by a Tyvek sheet. A chimney for LS filling and purification and for calibration operations connects the CD to the experimental hall from the top.

The CD has been dimensioned to meet the requirements presented in Section \ref{sec:juno:nom_precise_measurement}:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Its 20 ktons monolithic LS provides a volume sizeable enough, in combination with the expected $\bar{\nu}_e$ flux, to reach the desired statistic in 6 years. Its monolithic nature also allows for full containment of most of the events, preventing the energy loss in non-instrumented parts that would arise from a segmented detector.
  \item Its large overburden shields it from most of the atmospheric background that would pollute the signal.
  \item The localization of the experiment was chosen to maximize the disappearance with a 53km baseline and in a region that allows two nuclear power plants to be used as sources.
\end{itemize}

  \caption{}
\end{figure}

This section covers in detail the different components of the detector and the detection systems.

\subsection{Detection principle}
\label{sec:juno:detct}

The CD will detect the neutrino and measure their energy mainly via an Inverse Beta Decay (IBD) interaction with the proton, mainly from the $^{12}$C and H nucleus in the LS:
\begin{equation*}
  \bar{\nu}_e + p \rightarrow n + e^+
\end{equation*}
Kinematics calculation shows that this interaction has an energy threshold for the $\bar{\nu}_e$ of $ (m_n + m_e - m_p ) \approx 1.806 ~ \mathrm{MeV}$ \cite{strumia_precise_2003}.
This threshold makes the experiment blind to very low-energy neutrinos. The residual energy $E_{\nu} - 1.806 ~ \mathrm{MeV}$ is distributed as kinetic energy between the positron and the neutron.
The energy of the emitted positron $E_e$ is given by \cite{strumia_precise_2003}
\begin{equation}
  E_e = \frac{(E_\nu - \delta)(1+\epsilon_\nu) + \epsilon_\nu \cos \theta \sqrt{(E_\nu - \delta)^2 + \kappa m_e^2}}{\kappa}
\end{equation}
where $\kappa = (1 + \epsilon_\nu)^2 - \epsilon_\nu^2 \cos^2 \theta \approx 1$, $\epsilon_\nu = \frac{E_\nu}{m_p} \ll 1$ and $\delta = \frac{m_n^2 - m_p^2 - m_e^2}{2m_p} \ll 1$.
We can see from this equation that the positron energy is strongly correlated to the neutrino energy.


The positron and the neutron will then propagate in the detection medium, the Liquid Scintillator (LS), losing their kinetic energy by exciting the molecule of the LS (more details in Section \ref{sec:juno:LS}). Once stopped, the positron will annihilate with an electron from the medium producing two 511 KeV gammas. Those gammas will themselves interact with the LS, exciting it before being absorbed by photoelectrical effects. The neutron will be captured by an hydrogen, emitting a 2.2 MeV gamma in the process. This gamma will also deposit its energy before being absorbed by the LS.

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=8cm]{images/juno/IDB-JUNO.png}
  \caption{Schematics of an IBD interaction in the central detector of JUNO}
  \label{fig:juno:IBD}
\end{figure}

The scintillation photons have a frequency in the UV and will propagate in the LS, being re-absorbed and re-emitted by Compton effects before finally being captured by the PMTs instrumenting the acrylic sphere. The analog signal of the PMTs digitized by the electronic is the signal of our experiment. The signal produced by the positron is subsequently called the prompt signal, and the signal coming from the neutron is the delayed signal. This naming convention comes from the fact that the positron will deposit its energy rather quickly (few ns) whereas the neutron will take a bit more time ($\sim$ 236 $\mu$s).

\subsection{Central Detector (CD)}
\label{sec:juno:CD}

The central detector, composed of 20 ktons of Liquid Scintillator (LS), is the main part of JUNO. The LS is contained in a spherical acrylic vessel supported by a stainless steel structure. The CD and its structural support are submerged in a cylindrical water pool of 43.5m diameter and 44m height. We're confident that the water pool provides sufficient buffer protection in every direction against the rock radioactivity.
\subsubsection{Acrylic vessel}
The acrylic vessel is a spherical vessel with an inner diameter of 35.4 m and a thickness of 120 mm. It is assembled from 265 acrylic panels, thermo bonded together. The acrylic recipes have been carefully tuned with extensive R\&D to ensure it does not include plasticizer and anti-UV material that would stop the scintillation photons.
Those panels are required to be pure of radioactive materials to not cause background. The current setup where the acrylic panels are moulded in cleanrooms of class 10000, let us reach a uranium and thorium contamination of <0.5 ppt. The moulding and thermoforming processes are optimized to increase the assemblage transparency in water to >96\%. The acrylic vessel is supported by a stainless steel structure via a supporting node (fig \ref{fig:juno:sup_node}). The structure and the nodes are designed to be resilient to natural catastrophic events such as earthquakes and can support many times the effective load of the acrylic vessel.

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[height=4cm]{images/juno/node_b.png}
  \caption{Schematics of the supporting node for the acrylic vessel}
  \label{fig:juno:sup_node}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Liquid scintillator}
\label{sec:juno:LS}

The Liquid Scintillator (LS) has a similar recipe as the one used in Daya Bay \cite{bay_optimization_2020} but without gadolinium doping. It is made of three components, necessary to shift the wavelength of emitted photons to prevent their reabsorption and to shift their wavelength to the PMT sensitivity region as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:juno:LS_spectrum_and_PMT_sensitivity}:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The detection medium, the \textit{linear alkylbenzene} (LAB). Selected because of its excellent transparency, high flash point, low chemical reactivity, and good light yield. Accounting for $\sim 98\%$ of the LS, it is the main component with which ionizing particles and gamma interact. Charged particles will collide with its electronic cloud transferring energy to the molecules, gammas will interact via Compton effects with the electronic cloud before finally being absorbed via photoelectric effects.
  \item The second component of the LS is the \textit{2,5-diphenyloxazole} (PPO). A fraction of the excitation energy of the LAB is transferred to the PPO, mainly via non-radiative processes \cite{birks_chapter_1964}. The PPO molecules de-excites in the same way, transferring their energy to the bis-MSB. The PPO makes for $~1.5$ \% of the LS.
  \item The last component is the \textit{p-bis(o-methylstyryl)-benzene} (bis-MSB). Once excited by the PPO, it will emit photons with an average wavelength of $\sim430$ nm (full spectrum in Figure \ref{fig:juno:LS_spectrum_and_PMT_sensitivity}) that can thus be detected by our photo-multipliers systems. It amounts to $\sim 0.5$\% of the LS.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.48\textwidth}

  \label{fig:juno:LS_spectrum_and_PMT_sensitivity}
\end{figure}

This formula has been optimized using dedicated studies with a Daya Bay detector \cite{bay_optimization_2020, zhang_complete_2020} to reach the requirements for the JUNO experiment:
\begin{itemize}
  \item A light yield / MeV of the amount of $10^4$ photons to maximize the statistic in the energy measurement.
  \item An attenuation length comparable to the size of the detector to prevent losing photons during their propagation in the LS. The final attenuation length is 25.8m \cite{yang_light_2017} to compare with the CD diameter of 35.4m.
  \item Uranium/Thorium radiopurity to prevent background signal. The reactor neutrino program requires a contamination fraction $F<10^{-15}$ while the solar neutrino program requires $F<10^{-17}$.
\end{itemize}

The LS will frequently be purified and tested in the Online Scintillator Internal Radioactivity Investigation System (OSIRIS) \cite{juno_collaboration_design_2021} to ensure that the requirements are kept during the lifetime of the experiment, more details to be found in Section \ref{sec:juno:OSIRIS}.

\subsubsection{Large Photo-Multipliers Tubes (LPMTs)}
\label{sec:juno:LPMT}

The scintillation light produced by the LS is then collected by Photo-Multipliers Tubes (PMT) that transform the incoming photon into an electric signal. As described in Figure \ref{fig:juno:pmt-schem}, the incident photons interact with the photocathode via photoelectric effects producing an electron called a Photo-Electron (PE). This PE is then focused on the dynodes where the high voltage will allow it to be multiplied. After multiple amplification the resulting charge - in coulomb [C] - is collected by the anode and the resulting electric signal can be digitalized by the readout electronics from which the charge and timing can be extracted.

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[height=4cm]{images/juno/pmt_schematic.png}
  \caption{Schematic of a PMT}
  \label{fig:juno:pmt-schem}
\end{figure}

The Large Photo-Multipliers Tubes (LPMT), used in the central detector and in the water pool, are 20-inch (50.8 cm) radius PMTs. $\sim 5000$ dynode-PMTs \cite{noauthor_photomultiplier_nodate} were produced by the Hamamatsu$^{\copyright}$ company and $\sim 15000$ Micro-Channel Plate (MCP) \cite{abusleme_mass_2022} by the NNVT$^{\copyright}$ company. This system is the one responsible for the energy measurement with an energy resolution of $3\%/\sqrt{E}$, a resolution necessary for the mass ordering measurement. To reach this precision, the system is composed of 17612 PMTs quasi uniformly distributed over the detector for coverage of 75.2\% reaching $\sim 1800$ PE/MeV or $\sim 2.3 \%$ resolution due to statistic, leaving $\sim 0.7\%$ for the systematic uncertainties. They are located outside the acrylic sphere in the water pool facing the center of the detector.
To maintain the resolution over the lifetime of the experiment, JUNO requires a failure rate < 1\% over 6 years.

The LPMT's electronics are divided into two parts. One "near", located underwater, in proximity to the LPMT to reduce the cable length between the PMT and early electronic. A second one, outside of the detector is responsible for higher level analysis before sending the data to the DAQ.

The light yield per MeV induces that an LPMT can collect between 1 and 1000 PE per event, a wide dynamic range,  causing non-linearity in the PMT response that needs to be understood and calibrated, see Section \ref{sec:juno:calib} for more details.

Before performing analysis, the analog readout of the LPMT needs to be amplified, digitized, and packaged by the readout electronics schematized in Figure \ref{fig:juno:lpmt_elec}. This electronic is split into two parts: \textit{wet} electronics that are located near the LPMTs, protected in an Underwater Box (UWB), and the \textit{dry} electronics located in dedicated rooms outside of the water pool.

The LPMTs are connected to the UWB in groups of three. Each UWB contains:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Three high voltage units, each one powering a PMT.
  \item A global control unit, responsible for the digitization of the waveform, composed of six analog-digital units that produce digitized waveform and a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) that complete the waveform with metadata such as the local timestamp trigger, etc... This FPGA also act as a data buffer when needed by the DAQ and trigger system.
  \item Additional memory in order to temporally store the data in case of a sudden burst of the input rate (such as in the case of nearby supernovae).
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[height=6cm]{images/juno/LPMT_readout.png}
  \caption{The LPMT electronics scheme. It is composed of two parts, the \textit{wet} electronics on the left, located underwater, and the \textit{dry} electronics on the right. They are connected by Ethernet cable for data transmission and a dedicated low-impedance cable for power distribution}
  \label{fig:juno:lpmt_elec}
\end{figure}

The \textit{dry} electronic synchronizes the signals from the UWBs and centralizes the information of the CD LPMTs. It acts as the Global Trigger by sending the UWB data to DAQ in case the LPMT multiplicity condition is fulfilled.


\subsubsection{Small Photo-Multipliers Tubes (SPMTs)}
\label{sec:juno:SPMT}

The Small PMT (SPMTs) system is made of 3-inch (7.62 cm) PMTs. They will be used in the CD as a secondary detection system. Those 25600 SPMTs will observe the same events as the LPMTs, thus sharing the physics and detector systematics up until the photon conversion. With a detector coverage of 2.7\%, this system will collect $\sim 43$ PE/MeV for a final energy resolution of $\sim 17\%$. This resolution is not enough to measure the NMO, $\theta_{13}$, $\Delta m^2_{31}$ but will be sufficient to independently measure $\theta_{12}$ and $\Delta m^2_{21}$.

The benefit of this second system is to be able to perform another, independent measure of the same events as the LPMTs, constituting the Dual Calorimetry useful for calibration and, as we will explore in this thesis, for physics analysis.
Due to the low PE rate, SPMTs will be running in a photo-counting mode in the reactor range and thus will be insensitive to LPMT intrinsic effect (see Section \ref{sec:juno:calib}). Using this property, the intrinsic charge non-linearity of the LPMTs can be measured by comparing the PE count in the SPMTs and LPMTs \cite{han_dual_2021}. Also, due to their smaller size and electronics, SPMTs have a better timing resolution than the LPMTs.
At higher energy ranges, like supernovae events, LPMTs will saturate where SPMTs due to their lower PE collection will produce a reliable measure of the energy spectrum.

The SPMTs will be grouped by packs of 128 to a UWB hosting their electronics as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:juno:spmt_elec}. This underwater box hosts two high-voltage splitter boards, each one supplying 64 SPMTs, an ASIC Battery Card (ABC), and a global control unit.

The ABC board will read and digitize the charge and time of the 128 SPMTs signals and an FPGA will join the different metadata. The global control unit will handle the powering and control of the board and will be in charge of the transmission of the data to the DAQ.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Veto detector}

The CD will be bathed in constant background noise coming from numerous sources: the radioactivity from surrounding rock and its own components or from the flux of cosmic muons. This background needs to be rejected to ensure the purity of the IBD spectrum. To prevent a big part of them, JUNO uses two veto detectors that will tag events as background before CD analysis.

\subsubsection{Cherenkov in water pool}

The Water Cherenkov Detector (WCD) is the instrumentation of the water buffer around the CD. When high-speed charged particles will pass through the water and produce Cherenkov photons. The light will be collected by 2400 MCP LPMTs installed on the outer surface of the CD structure. The muons veto strategy is based on a PMT multiplicity condition. WCD PMTs are grouped into ten zones: 5 in the top, and 5 in the bottom. A veto is raised either when more than 19 PMTs are triggered in one zone or when two adjacent zones simultaneously trigger more than 13 PMTs. Using this trigger, we expect to reach a muon detection efficiency of 99.5\% while keeping the noise at a reasonable level.

\subsubsection{Top tracker}
The JUNO Top Tracker (TT) is a plastic scintillator detector located on the top of the experiment (see Figure \ref{fig:juno:tt}). Made from a plastic scintillator from OPERA \cite{acquafredda_opera_2009} layered horizontally in 3 layers on the top of the detector, the TT will be able to detect incoming atmospheric muons.
With its coverage, about 1/3 of the atmospheric muons that are passing through the CD will also pass through the 3 layers of the detector. While it does not cover the majority of the CD, the TT is particularly effective in detecting muons coming through the filling chimney region which might present difficulties from the other subsystems in some classes of events.
\begin{figure}[ht]

  \includegraphics[height=5cm]{images/juno/Global_TT_01.png}
  \caption{The JUNO top tracker}
  \label{fig:juno:tt}
\end{figure}

\section{Calibration strategy}
\label{sec:juno:calib}

The calibration is a crucial part of the JUNO experiment. The detector will continuously bathe in neutrinos coming from the close nuclear power plant, from other sources such as geo neutrinos, from the sun, and will be exposed to background noise coming from atmospheric muons and natural radioactivity.
Because of this continuous rate, low-frequency signal event, we need high-frequency, recognizable sources in the energy range of interest : [0-12] MeV for the positron signal and 2.2 MeV for the neutron capture.
It is expected that the CD response will be different depending on the type of particle, due to the interaction with LS, the position on the event, and the optical response of the acrylic sphere (see Section \ref{sec:juno:reco}).
We also expect a non-linear energy response of the CD due to the LS properties \cite{bay_optimization_2020} but also due to the response of the LPMTs system when collecting a large amount of PE \cite{han_dual_2021}.

\subsection{Energy scale calibration}

While electron and positron sources would be ideal, for a large LS detector thin-walled electrons or positron sources could lead to leakage of radionuclides causing radioactive contamination. Instead, we consider gamma sources in the range of the prompt energy of IBDs. The sources are reported in table \ref{tab:juno:calib_source}.

\begin{table}[ht]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
    \hline
    Sources / Processes & Type & Radiation \\
    \hline
    $^{137}$Cs          & $\gamma$ & 0.0662 MeV \\
    $^{54}$Mn           & $\gamma$ & 0.835 MeV \\
    $^{60}$Co           & $\gamma$ & 1.173 + 1.333 MeV \\
    $^{40}$K            & $\gamma$ & 1.461 MeV \\
    $^{68}$Ge           & $e^{+}$  &  annihilation 0.511 + 0.511 MeV \\
    $^{241}$Am-Be       & $n,\gamma$ & neutron + 4.43 MeV (${12}$C*) \\
    $^{241}$Am-$^{13}$C & $n,\gamma$ & neutron + 6.13 MeV (${16}$O*) \\
    $(n, \gamma)p$      & $\gamma$ & 2.22 MeV \\
    $(n, \gamma)^{12}$C & $\gamma$ & 4.94 MeV or 3.68 + 1.26 MeV \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{List of sources and their process considered for the energy scale calibration}
  \label{tab:juno:calib_source}
\end{table}

For the $^{68}$Ge source, it will decay in $^{68}$Ga via electron capture, which will itself $\beta^+$ decay into $^{68}$Zn. The positrons will be absorbed by the enclosure so only the annihilation gamma will be released. In addition, $(\alpha, n)$ sources like $^{241}$Am-Be and $^{241}$Am-$^{13}$C are used to provide both high energy gamma and neutrons, which will later be captured in the LS producing the 2.2 MeV gamma.

From this calibration, we call $E_{vis}$ the "visible energy" that is reconstructed by our current algorithms and we compare it to the true energy deposited by the calibration source. The results shown in Figure \ref{fig:juno:nl} show the expected response of the detector from calibration sources. The non-linearity is clearly visible from the $E_{vis} / E_{true}$ shape. See \cite{juno_collaboration_calibration_2021} for more details.

\subsection{Calibration system}

The non-uniformity due to the event position in the detector (more details in Section \ref{sec:juno:reco}) will be studied using multiple systems that are schematized in Figure \ref{fig:juno:calib}. They allow to position sources at different locations in the CD.

\begin{itemize}
  \item For a one-dimension vertical calibration, the Automatic Calibration Unit (ACU) will be able to deploy multiple radioactive sources or a pulse laser diffuser ball along the central axis of the CD through the top chimney. The source position precision is less than 1cm.
  \item For off-axis calibration, a calibration source attached to a Cable Loop System (CLS) can be moved on a vertical half-plane by adjusting the length of two connection cables. Two sets of CSL will be deployed to provide a 79\% effective coverage of a vertical plane.
  \item A Guiding Tube (GT) will surround the CD to calibrate the non-uniformity of the response at the edge of the detector
  \item A Remotely Operated under-LS Vehicle (ROV) can be deployed to the desired location inside LS for more precise and comprehensive calibration. The ROV will also be equipped with a camera for inspection of the CD.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Instrumental non-linearity calibration}
\label{sec:juno:instr_nl}

One of the main interests of Dual Calorimetry is to calibrate away an instrumental effect called charge non-linearity (QNL), which will be described in more detail in Chapter \ref{sec:joint_fit}.

In short, during a typical IBD event, between 0 and 100 PEs can be produced in a given LPMT (depending on the position of the interaction and the positron energy). This is a large dynamic range. When the number of PEs is high, the reconstruction of the LPMT charge can become inaccurate, underestimating the actual number of PEs as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:juno:instr_nl}. This QNL is difficult to separate from other non-linearities (like the non-linearity in the LS photon yield as a function of the deposited energy). In Chapters 5 and 6 of this thesis \cite{han_dual_2021}, a calibration method that constitutes the core of dual calorimetry is described.  They are based on the comparisons between signals seen in LPMTs and signals seen in SPMTs. In the latter system, due to its small angular coverage, individual SPMT rarely see more than 1 PE per event and therefore are essentially immune against QNL. The method described in \cite{han_dual_2021} uses a tunable light source covering the range of 0 to 100 PE per LPMT channel.

The solid red line represents event-level non-linearity without the channel-level correction in an extreme hypothetical scenario of 50\% non-linearity over 100 PEs for the LPMTs. The dashed blue line represents that after the channel-level correction. The gray band shows the residual uncertainty of 0.3\%, after the channel-level correction.

\end{figure}


\section{Satellite detectors}
As introduced in Section \ref{sec:juno:nu_e_flux} and Section \ref{sec:juno:LS}, the precise knowledge and understanding of the detector condition are crucial for the measurements of the NMO and oscillation parameters. Thus two satellite detectors will be set up to monitor the experiment condition. TAO to monitor and understand the $\bar{\nu}_e$ flux and spectrum coming from the nuclear reactor and OSIRIS to monitor the LS response.

\subsection{TAO}
\label{sec:juno:tao}
The Taishan Antineutrino Observatory (TAO) \cite{juno_collaboration_tao_2020, steiger_tao_2022} is a ton-level gadolinium doped liquid scintillator detector that will be located near the Taishan-1 reactor. It aims to measure the $\bar{\nu}_e$ spectrum at a very low distance (44m) from the reactor to measure a quasi-unoscillated spectrum. TAO also aims to provide a major contribution to the so-called reactor anomaly \cite{mention_reactor_2011}. Its requirements are to the level of 2 \% energy resolution at 1 MeV.

\subsubsection{Detector}

The TAO detector is close, in concept, to the CD of JUNO. It is composed of an acrylic vessel containing 2.8 tons of gadolinium-loaded LS instrumented by an array of silicon photomultipliers (SiPM) reaching a 95\% coverage. To efficiently reduce the dark count of those sensors, the detector is cooled to -50 \textcelsius.
The $\bar{\nu}_e$ will interact with the LS via IBD, producing scintillation light, that will be detected by the SiPMs. From this signal, the $\bar{\nu}_e$ energy and the full spectrum are reconstructed.
This spectrum will then be used by JUNO to calibrate the unoscillated spectrum, most notably the fission product fraction that impacts the rate and shape of the spectrum. A schema of the detector is presented in Figure \ref{fig:juno:tao}.

\subsection{OSIRIS}
\label{sec:juno:OSIRIS}
The Online Scintillator Internal Radioactivity Investigation System (OSIRIS) \cite{juno_collaboration_design_2021} is an ultralow background, 20 m$^3$ LS detector that will be located in JUNO cavern. It aims to monitor the radioactive contamination, purity, and overall response of the LS before it is injected into JUNO.
OSIRIS will be located at the end of the purification chain of JUNO, monitoring that the purified LS meets the JUNO requirements. The setup is optimized to detect the fast coincidences decay of $^{214}\mathrm{Bi}-^{214}\mathrm{Po}$ and $^{212}\mathrm{Bi}-^{212}\mathrm{Po}$, indicators of the decay chains of U and Th respectively.
\subsubsection{Detector}
OSIRIS is composed of an acrylic vessel that will contain 17t of LS. The LS is instrumented by a PMT array of 64 20-inch PMTs on the top and the side of the vessel. To reach the necessary background level required by the LS purity measurements, in addition to being 700m underground in the experiment cavern, the acrylic vessel is immersed in a tank of ultra-pure water. The water is itself instrumented by another array of 20-inch PMTs, acting as muon veto. A schema of the detector is presented in Figure \ref{fig:juno:osiris}.

\section{Software}
\label{sec:juno:software}

The simulation, reconstruction, and analysis algorithms are all packaged in the JUNO software, subsequently called the software.
It is composed of multiple components integrated into the SNiPER \cite{lin_application_2017} framework:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Various primary particle simulators for the different kinds of events, backgrounds, and calibration sources.
  \item A Geant4 \cite{agostinelli_geant4simulation_2003, allison_geant4_2006, allison_recent_2016} Monte Carlo (MC) simulation containing the detectors geometries, a custom optical model for the LS and the supporting structures of the detectors. The Geant4 simulation integrates all relevant physics processes for JUNO, validated by the collaboration. This step of the simulation is commonly called \textit{Detsim} and computes up to the production of photo-electrons in the PMTs. The optics properties of the different materials and detector components have been measured beforehand to be used to define the material and surfaces in the simulation.
  \item An electronic simulation, simulating the response waveform of the PMTs, tracking it through the digitization process, accounting for effects such as non-linearity, dark noise, Time Transit Spread (TTS), pre-pulsing, after-pulsing, and ringing if the waveform. It's also the step that handles the event triggers and mixing. This step is commonly referenced as \textit{Elecsim}.
  \item A waveform reconstruction where the digitized waveforms are filtered to remove high-frequency white noise and then deconvoluted to yield time and charge information of the photons hits on the PMTs. This step is commonly referenced as \textit{Calib}.
  \item The charge and time information are used by reconstruction algorithms to reconstruct the interaction vertex and the deposited energy. This step is commonly reported as \textit{Reco}. See Section \ref{sec:juno:reco} for more details on the reconstruction.
  \item The selection of IBD events is based on the coincidence in time and space of a prompt and a delayed signal -- selection called event pairing. This is explained in detail in Section \ref{sec:juno:Fit:selection}. The pairing and the identification of background signals is called Event Classification.
  \item The purified signal is then analyzed by the analysis framework which depends on the physics topic of interest. An introduction to the reactor $\bar{nu}_e$ is presented in Section \ref{sec:juno:Fit}.
\end{itemize}

The steps Reco and Event Classification are divided into two categories of algorithms. Fast but less accurate algorithms that are running during the data taking are designated as the \textit{Online} algorithms. Those algorithms are used to make the decision to save the event on tape or to throw it away. And more accurate algorithms that run on batches of events designated \textit{Offline} algorithms. They are used for physics analysis. The Offline Reco will be one of the main topics of interest for this thesis.


\section{Reactor anti-neutrino oscillation analysis}
\label{sec:juno:Fit}


\subsection{IBD samples selection}
\label{sec:juno:Fit:selection}

The $\bar{\nu}_e$ coming from nuclear reactors will, for the most part, interact with a proton, a hydrogen nuclei, via Inverse Beta Decay (IBD).
The first step of the oscillation analysis is to constitute a sample of IBD candidates, dominated by actual IBDs. The IBD interaction, schematized in Figure \ref{fig:juno:IBD}, will produce two particles, with differentiable signals.

The first signal comes from the positron slowdown and its annihilation with an electron of the LS. This is the \textit{prompt} signal, happening a few ns after the IBD. The positron takes most of the $\bar{\nu}_e$ kinetic energy, as detailed in Section \ref{sec:juno:detct}.

The leftover kinetic energy is taken by the neutron that, after thermalization in the LS, will be captured by an hydrogen and produce a 2.2 MeV gamma, or by a carbon-emitting a 4.9 MeV gamma. This is the \textit{delayed} signal, happening $\sim$236 $\mu$s after the IBD. This second mono-energetic event serves as a marker for the IBD.

The IBD selection is thus based on the selection of a prompt event, with an energy between 0.8 and 12 MeV, and a delayed event with an energy in the ranges $[1.9, 2.5]$ MeV or $[4.4, 5.5]$ MeV. Those two signals need to be in a 1 ms time window and within 1.5 m from each other. Additionally, the two signals need to be in a radius of 17.2m from the detector center (0.5 m from the edge) to protect from accidental background formed by two uncorrelated signals \cite{abusleme_potential_2024}. Those values will be further refined once JUNO data-taking starts.

In addition, special vetoes are set up to protect from cosmic muons and their aftermath. The details of those vetoes and selections can be found in \cite{abusleme_potential_2024}.

The expected rate and selection efficiency on IBD can be found in table \ref{tab:juno:ibd_selection}. After these selections, the residual background, including $\bar{\nu}_e$ coming from other sources than the reactor can be found in table \ref{tab:juno:res_bg}.

\end{table}

Once a sample is obtained, the oscillation analysis will consist essentially of the fit of a spectrum model to the spectrum observed in the selected sample. More specifically, the spectrum under analysis is the spectrum of the reconstructed visible energy of the positron: $E^{vis}$.
The reconstruction is presented in detail in Section \ref{sec:juno:reco}. For 6 years of data taking, it will resemble that on Figure \ref{fig:juno:spectrum_with_background}. In the next sections, I describe the fit procedures developed in JUNO. This will be the occasion to introduce notions useful for Chapter \ref{sec:joint_fit}. Besides, I'll also describe the versions of the fit used in this Chapter \ref{sec:joint_fit}.

Several fit procedures are being developed by JUNO collaborators (half a dozen groups work in parallel within the collaboration). We do not have the ambition of a thorough description here. Instead, we try to introduce the main elements useful to the reader to understand JUNO's future results, and the fit procedures used in Chapter \ref{sec:joint_fit}.

In most cases, the fit is a binned fit to the histogrammed spectrum of $E_{vis}^{e^+}$, like the one in Figure \ref{fig:juno:spectrum_with_background}. It is based on the minimization of a $\chi^2$ test statistic. Generically, it can be written this way :
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:juno:chi2}
  \chi^2= \left(\bm{T}(\bm{\theta},\bm{\eta}) - \bm{D}  \right)^T V^{-1} \left(\bm{T}(\bm{\theta},\bm{\eta}) - \bm{D} \right) + \chi^2_{nuis}(\bm{\eta})
\end{equation}
where the components of data vector $\bm{D}$ are the number of events found in individual bins of the fitted histogram, $\bm{T}(\bm{\theta},\bm{\eta})$ is the vector of the predicted number of entries in each bins. This prediction is the integration over the width of the bins of the spectrum model for a given NMO (described later in this section).

This model depends on the oscillation parameters $\bm{\theta} = \left(\Delta m^2_{21}, \sin^2(2\theta_{12}), \Delta m^2_{31}, \sin^2(2\theta_{13} )\right)$, and on nuisance parameters $\bm{\eta}$ -- parameters that do not constitute the goals of the measurements, but that still characterize our spectrum -- involved in the fit model and associated with systematic uncertainties. Examples of nuisance parameters in JUNO are the expected background amplitude and the Earth's crust density.
Uncertainties are treated in two ways: statistical and some of the systematic uncertainties are accounted for via the covariance matrix $V = V_{stat}+V_{syst}$; remaining systematic uncertainties are treated via the penalty term $\chi^2_{nuis}$, which is written this way :
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:juno:nuis}
  \chi^2_{nuis}\left(\bm{\eta}\right)= \left(\bm{\eta}-\bm{\bar{\eta}}\right)^T \cdot V^{-1}_{\bm{\eta}}(\bm{\eta})  \cdot \left(\bm{\eta}-\bm{\bar{\eta}}\right)
\end{equation}
where $\bm{\bar{\eta}}$ is the vector containing the most probable values of the nuisance parameters according to our knowledge prior to the fit, and where $V_{\bm{\eta}}$ is the covariance matrix accounting of the uncertainty on these values, and the potential correlations between them.
In principles, a likelihood could be used instead of a $\chi^2$. However, some of the systematic uncertainties are not trivial to parameterize, therefore treating them as nuisance parameters is not trivial.

Examples of nuisance parameters are the $A$, $B$, and $C$ parameters of equation \ref{eq:joint_fit:abc}, which can be used to describe the resolution of the reconstructed energy. The fit model leading to $\bm{T}\left(\bm{\theta},\bm{\eta}\right)$ indeed incorporates this resolution.

\subsubsection{Treatment of uncertainties}

Differences between various fit procedures developed within JUNO often lie in the choice of the systematic uncertainties that are treated via $V$ or $\chi^2_{nuis}(\bm{\eta})$. Among the reasons behind these differences is the necessity to compare several approaches to ensure the robustness of JUNO's oscillation analysis results. This approach was already adopted in the recent evaluations of JUNO's potential \cite{abusleme_potential_2024, juno_collaboration_sub-percent_2022}. Studies carried out so far at Subatech assume a treatment entirely via $V$.

Other differences lie in the choice of the way to evaluate $V_{stat}$. Two common approaches used in $\chi^2$ fit are the Neyman and the Pearson approaches. If the size of the fitted sample is high enough, the variation of $D_i$, the number of entries in bin $i$, around its true expectation value $\bar{D}_i$ is $\sqrt{\bar{D_i}}$. To evaluate this number, the Neyman approach uses simply the number of entries observed in the sample under analysis: $\sqrt{D_i}$. The Pearson approach uses the prediction by the fit model: $\sqrt{T(\bm{\theta},\bm{\eta})_i}$.

Both cases are approximations that lead to biases that are not tolerable given the precision JUNO must aim at for a successful oscillation analysis. To reduce this bias, most JUNO groups employ the "Combined Neyman Pearson" approach introduced in \cite{ji_combined_2019}. Schematically, it consists of combining both approaches :
$\left(V_{stat}\right)_{ii} = 3/\left(\frac{1}{T(\bm{\theta},\bm{\eta})_i}+\frac{2}{D_i}\right)$.
Weights in this relation are chosen in order to cancel typical biases. The validity of this method is not guaranteed universally. In particular, limitations appear when a complex systematic matrix $V_{syst}$ is added to $V_{stat}$.

This is the case in the approach followed at Subatech, where all sources of systematic uncertainties are treated via this matrix. Dedicated studies run at Subatech observed biases in the fitted oscillation parameters using CNP in this case. Subatech's group therefore adopted another approach (verified to be unbiased).

Originally, fitting the $E^{e^+}_{vis}$ spectrum should mean maximizing a likelihood, equal to the product over all bins of the probabilities to find $D_i$ in bin $i$. With large enough samples, this product tends to be a multidimensional Gaussian (one dimension per bin) :
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{L} = 2\pi^{-\frac{N}{2}} |V|^{-\frac{1}{2}}  e^{-\frac{1}{2}\left(\bm{D}-\bm{T}(\bm{\theta},\bm{\eta})\right)^T V^{-1} \left( \bm{D}-\bm{T}(\bm{\theta},\vec{\eta}) \right)}
\end{equation}
Replacing $\mathcal{L}$ by $-2 \ln \mathcal{L}$ one obtains :
\begin{equation}
\chi^2_{PV} = \left(\bm{T}(\bm{\theta},\bm{\eta}) - \bm{D} \right)^T V^{-1} \left(\bm{T}(\bm{\theta},\bm{\eta}) - \bm{D}  \right) + \ln(|V|)
\end{equation}
where $V$ is the total covariance matrix with its statistical component evaluated according to the Pearson approach. The $\ln|V|$ term, often neglected in $\chi^2$ fits, ensures that biases, essentially related to the normalization of the fitted distribution, are avoided. This "PearsonV" $\chi^2$ is the one that we minimize in the fits used in Chapter \ref{sec:joint_fit}.

Another difference between the various procedures developed at JUNO is the choice of the spectrum range and binning. So far, at Subatech, we use a histogram defined between 0.8 and 9 MeV, and a regular binning involving 20 keV wide bins.

\subsubsection{Joint fit of JUNO and TAO spectra}

Another difference between the various fit procedures developed in the collaboration is the inclusion of the data collected by TAO (see Section \ref{sec:juno:tao}). The spectrum prediction $\bm{T}(\bm{\theta},\bm{\eta})$ involves predictions on the differential flux of $\bar{\nu}_e$ as a function of $E_{\bar{\nu}_e}$ produced in reactors. This is one of the main systematic uncertainties affecting the oscillation analysis. This can be constrained using the data of TAO. An efficient way to use them is via a simultaneous fit, which will constrain the part of the $\bm{\eta}$ parameters related to the reactor predictions. In this case, equation \ref{eq:juno:chi2} becomes :
\begin{equation}
  \chi^2 = \sum_{d}\left(\bm{T}^d(\bm{\theta}^d,\bm{\eta}) - \bm{D}^d  \right)^T V^{-1} \left(\bm{T}^d(\bm{\theta}^d,\bm{\eta}) - \bm{D}^d  \right) +  \chi^2_{nuis}(\bm{\eta})
\end{equation}
where the $d$ superscript stands for the spectrum measured in JUNO or TAO.

Finally, it must be noted that JUNO's sensitivity to $\sin^2(2\theta_{13})$ is too weak for a competitive measurement. In most versions of the oscillation analyses carried out within JUNO, it will be considered a nuisance parameter. In practice, the various $\chi^2$'s presented earlier will receive an additional term :
\begin{equation}
  \chi^2_{\sin^2(2\theta_{13})} = \frac{(\sin^2(2\theta_{13})-\overline{\sin^2(2\theta_{13})})^2}{\sigma^2_{\overline{\sin^2(2\theta_{13})}}}
\end{equation}
where $\overline{\sin^2(2\theta_{13})}$ and the denominators can be provided, for instance, by the world average on this parameter.

\subsection{The spectrum model and sources of systematic uncertainties}

The $E^{e^+}_{vis}$ spectrum observed in data (Fig \ref{fig:juno:spectrum_with_background}) is the sum of the IBD spectrum and of the various backgrounds spectra (see table \ref{tab:juno:res_bg}).
The spectrum prediction $\bm{T}\left(\bm{\theta},\bm{\eta}\right)$ is, therefore, the sum of IBD and background predictions. The latter are provided by MC simulations. The former results from the theoretical description of the series of phenomena that lead to the observed IBD spectrum. In a given bin $i$, it can be expressed this way :
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:juno:bin_content}
  T^i(\bm{\theta},\bm{\eta}) =\sum_{j} C_{ij}^{E_{rec}} \int_{E^{vis}_{j}}^{E^{vis}_{j+1}} \dd E^{vis} \int_{-1}^{1} \mathrm{dcos}\theta ~ \Phi(E^{\nu}) \frac{\dd\sigma}{\mathrm{dcos}\theta}(E^{\nu}, \cos\theta) \frac{\dd E^{\nu}}{\dd E^{dep}} \frac{\dd E^{dep}}{\dd E^{vis}}
\end{equation}
In the above equation, 4 kinds of energies appear: following the IBD, the antineutrino energy $E^{\nu}$ is quasi-entirely transferred to the positron, of energy $E_{e}$. It eventually annihilates, so the actual energy released in the LS is $E_{dep}$, which includes the mass of the annihilated electron. The production of optical photons is not linear in $E_{dep}$ (see Section \ref{sec:juno:calib}), so the visible energy (that will be reconstructed) is $E_{vis}$. This reconstruction comes with resolution effects, leading to $E_{rec}$.

Equation \ref{eq:juno:bin_content} describes the passage from the original differential flux (as a function of $E^{\nu}$ ) of antineutrinos reaching the detector to the reconstructed spectrum:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $\Phi(E^{\nu})$ is the differential antineutrino flux reaching JUNO.
  \item $\frac{\dd\sigma}{\mathrm{dcos}\theta}(E^{\nu}, \cos\theta)$ account for the IBD cross-section, which depends on the antineutrino energy and on the incidence angle.
  \item The last two terms of the integrand are the differential relations linking $E^{\nu}$, $E^{dep}$ and $E^{vis}$.
  \item Reconstruction effects are described via $C^{rec}_{ij}$'s, which make the link between the true and reconstructed visible energy. In a simple case, it is equivalent to a convolution product. The matrix formalism here prepares the fact that a realistic analysis might employ a more empirical way, based on MC.
\end{itemize}
\hfill

The differential flux is expressed this way:
\begin{equation}
\Phi(E^{\nu}) = \sum_{r} \left( \frac{{\cal P}_{\bar{\nu}_e\rightarrow \bar{\nu}_e}(E^{\nu},L_r)}{4\pi L^2_r} \frac{W_r}{\sum_{i} f_{i,r} e_i} \sum_{i} f_{i,r} s_i(E^{\nu}) \right)
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{itemize}
  \item ${\cal P}_{\bar{\nu}_e\rightarrow \bar{\nu}_e}(E^{\nu},L_r)$ is the antineutrino survival probability at distance $L_r$ from the production point in reactor $r$, dictated by the oscillation probability.
  \item $e_i$ stands for the mean energy released per fission for isotope $i$.
  \item $W_r$ is the thermal power of reactor $r$.
  \item $f_{i,r}$ is the fission fraction in reactor $r$ of isotope $i$ among the four.
  \item $s_i(E^{\nu})$ is the $\bar{\nu}_e$ energy spectrum - at emission point -  per fission for each isotope, as emitted by the reactor.
\end{itemize}
\hfill

\subsubsection{Sources of systematic uncertainties}

The numerous quantities appearing in the spectrum model embody a good part of the systematic uncertainties. Among the leading contributions are those related to the knowledge of the reactor-related quantities. Of importance are also the uncertainties related to the modelling of the non-linearity of the photon emission (passage from $E^{dep}$ to $E^{vis}$) and of the reconstruction resolution. The shape and rate of the backgrounds are also a leading source of systematic uncertainties. The uncertainty on IBD selection efficiency also has a notable role.

\subsubsection{Sensitivities to NMO and oscillation parameters}

JUNO will start taking data in 2025. During the months and years to come, oscillation analyses will naturally be optimized regularly. What we described here represents the state of the art mid=2024, and was used for the sensitivity studies published in \cite{abusleme_potential_2024, juno_collaboration_sub-percent_2022} and are presented in table \ref{tab:juno:juno-param-precision}

\subsubsection{Asimov studies}
\label{sec:juno:Fit:asimov}

To study the behavior and performance of fit procedures with enough realism, one should perform fits to a large number of toy spectra, generated with a number of events equal to what one expects in real data, for the given exposure under consideration. This allows us to study the impact of realistic statistical fluctuations. This is, however, time-consuming, since thousands of spectra have to be generated and fitted.

When subtle details are not crucial, another approach is possible to estimate sensitivities to the NMO and oscillation parameters, as well as (for instance) to verify the technical implementation of fitter (as we will do in Chapter \ref{sec:joint_fit} for the implementation of the joint fit). It consists of generating only 1 pseudo-data sample, where the content of each bin $D^i$ is set to the predicted value $T^i$, computed with a reasonable choice for the values of the model parameters (for instance, with the recent PDG values for the oscillation parameters). This is equivalent to a spectrum with fluctuations. It provides valid sensitivities if the expected statistics in the real data sample are high enough in each bin to assume a Gaussian behaviour.

\subsection{Versions of the fit used in this thesis}

In Chapter \ref{sec:joint_fit}, we'll study the potential of a particular application of Dual Calorimetry, called "Dual Calorimetry with neutrino oscillation." This approach requires performing fits to the $E^{vis}$ spectrum reconstructed with the LPMT system, with the SPMT system, and a joint fit to both spectra.

In the two former cases, the PearsonV $\chi^2$ introduced above will be used. In the latter case, it will be extended in the following way: The $\bm{D}$ data vector now possesses 820 elements. Indeed, the fit is performed to a joint spectrum, where the LPMT spectrum is juxtaposed with the SPMT spectrum (see Figure \ref{fig:juno:joint_fit_spec}).

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[height=5cm]{images/juno/joint_fit.png}
  \caption{Illustration of the spectrum considered when joint fitting}
  \label{fig:juno:joint_fit_spec}
\end{figure}

The prediction vector $\bm{T}\left(\bm{\theta}^d,\bm{\eta}\right)$ is naturally extended in the same way. Its components 1 to 410 predict the number of entries in the LPMT part of the LPMT+SPMT joint spectrum, while its components from 411 to 820 predict the contents of the SPMT part. Note that the list of oscillation parameters in $T_{411}(\bm{\theta}^d,\bm{\eta})$ to $T_{820}(\bm{\theta}^d,\bm{\eta})$ is the same as usual. However, $T_1(\bm{\theta}^d,\bm{\eta})$ to $T_{410}(\bm{\theta}^d,\bm{\eta})$ 2 additional parameters, $\delta \sin^2(2\theta_{12})$ and $\delta \Delta m^2_{21}$, are added to the corresponding oscillation parameters to account for a potential unexpected problem in the LPMT reconstruction or calibration.

In the case of this joint fit, the covariance matrix $V$ is extended to a $(820 \times 820)$ matrix. It is a central element of this study, as will be explained in Chapter \ref{sec:joint_fit}, since the LPMT and SPMT data spectrum are correlated, even at the statistical level. The determination of this matrix will be an important and original point.

Fits will be performed to a histogram spectrum defined over the 0.8-9 MeV range, with a flat binning (20 keV wide bins), often restricted to the 335 lowest $E^{vis}$ bins.

In this Section \ref{sec:juno:Fit}, we have provided a theoretical description of the fit procedures developed at JUNO. Software frameworks are necessary to use them in practice. The framework developed at Subatech will be described in Chapter \ref{sec:joint_fit}.

\subsection{Physics results}

The oscillation parameters are directly extracted from the minimization procedure and the error can be estimated directly from the procedure. For the NMO, the data are fitted under the two assumptions of NO and IO. The difference in $\chi^2$ gives us the preferred ordering and the significance of our test. Latest studies show that the precision on oscillation parameters after six years of data taking will be 0.2\%, 0.3\%, 0.5\% and 12.1\% for $\Delta m^2_{31}$, $\Delta m^2_{21}$, $\sin^2\theta_{12}$ and $\sin^2\theta_{13}$ respectively \cite{juno_collaboration_sub-percent_2022}. The expected sensitivity to mass ordering is $3\sigma$ after 6.5 years \cite{juno_collaboration_juno_2022}.

\section{Summary}

JUNO is one of the biggest new-generation neutrino experiments. Its goal, the measurements of oscillation parameters with unprecedented precision and an NMO preference at the 3 sigma confidence level, needs in-depth knowledge and understanding of the detector and the physics at hand. The characterization and calibration of the detector are of the utmost importance and the understanding of the detector response in its resolution and bias is capital to be able to correctly carry out the high-precision physics analysis of the neutrino oscillation.

In this thesis, I explore the usage of data-driven reconstruction methods to validate and optimize the reconstruction of IBD events in JUNO in the chapters \ref{sec:jcnn}, \ref{sec:jgnn} and \ref{sec:janne} and the usage of the dual calorimetry in the detection of possible mis-modelization in the theoretical spectrum \ref{sec:joint_fit}.
