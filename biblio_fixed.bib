	abstract = {We argue that the estimation of mutual information between high dimensional continuous random variables can be achieved by gradient descent over neural networks. We present a Mutual Information Neural Estimator (MINE) that is linearly scalable in dimensionality as well as in sample size, trainable through back-prop, and strongly consistent. We present a handful of applications on which MINE can be used to minimize or maximize mutual information. We apply MINE to improve adversarially trained generative models. We also use MINE to implement Information Bottleneck, applying it to supervised classification; our results demonstrate substantial improvement in flexibility and performance in these settings.},

	abstract = {Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are analyzed via the theoretical framework of the information bottleneck (IB) principle. We first show that any DNN can be quantified by the mutual information between the layers and the input and output variables. Using this representation we can calculate the optimal information theoretic limits of the DNN and obtain finite sample generalization bounds. The advantage of getting closer to the theoretical limit is quantifiable both by the generalization bound and by the network's simplicity. We argue that both the optimal architecture, number of layers and features/connections at each layer, are related to the bifurcation points of the information bottleneck tradeoff, namely, relevant compression of the input layer with respect to the output layer. The hierarchical representations at the layered network naturally correspond to the structural phase transitions along the information curve. We believe that this new insight can lead to new optimality bounds and deep learning algorithms.},

	abstract = {We examine a class of stochastic deep learning models with a tractable method to compute information-theoretic quantities. Our contributions are three-fold: (i) We show how entropies and mutual informations can be derived from heuristic statistical physics methods, under the assumption that weight matrices are independent and orthogonally-invariant. (ii) We extend particular cases in which this result is known to be rigorously exact by providing a proof for two-layers networks with Gaussian random weights, using the recently introduced adaptive interpolation method. (iii) We propose an experiment framework with generative models of synthetic datasets, on which we train deep neural networks with a weight constraint designed so that the assumption in (i) is verified during learning. We study the behavior of entropies and mutual information throughout learning and conclude that, in the proposed setting, the relationship between compression and generalization remains elusive.},

	abstract = {The outer water buffer is an economic option to shield the external radiative backgrounds for liquid-scintillator neutrino detectors. However, the consequential total reflection of scintillation light at the media boundary introduces extra complexity to the detector optics. This paper develops a precise detector-response model by investigating how total reflection complicates photon propagation and degrades reconstruction. We first parameterize the detector response by regression, providing an unbiased energy and vertex reconstruction in the total reflection region while keeping the number of parameters under control. From the experience of event degeneracy at the Jinping prototype, we then identify the root cause as the multimodality in the reconstruction likelihood function, determined by the refractive index of the buffer, detector scale and PMT coverage. To avoid multimodality, we propose a straightforward criterion based on the expected photo-electron-count ratios between neighboring PMTs. The criterion will be used to ensure success in future liquid-scintillator detectors by guaranteeing the effectiveness of event reconstruction.},

The majority of this work focuses on a binary domain label. Similar problems occur in a scientific context where there may be a continuous family of plausible data generation processes associated to the presence of systematic uncertainties. Robust inference is possible if it is based on a pivot -- a quantity whose distribution does not depend on the unknown values of the nuisance parameters that parametrize this family of data generation processes. In this work, we introduce and derive theoretical results for a training procedure based on adversarial networks for enforcing the pivotal property (or, equivalently, fairness with respect to continuous attributes) on a predictive model. The method includes a hyperparameter to control the trade-off between accuracy and robustness. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach with a toy example and examples from particle physics.},

	abstract = {The field of high-energy physics (HEP), along with many scientific disciplines, is currently experiencing a dramatic influx of new methodologies powered by modern machine learning techniques. Over the last few years, a growing body of HEP literature has focused on identifying promising applications of deep learning in particular, and more recently these techniques are starting to be realized in an increasing number of experimental measurements. The overall conclusion from this impressive and extensive set of studies is that rarer and more complex physics signatures can be identified with the new set of powerful tools from deep learning. However, there is an unstudied systematic risk associated with combining the traditional HEP workflow and deep learning with high-dimensional data. In particular, calibrating and validating the response of deep neural networks is in general not experimentally feasible, and therefore current methods may be biased in ways that are not covered by current uncertainty estimates. By borrowing ideas from AI safety, we illustrate these potential issues and propose a method to bound the size of unaccounted for uncertainty. In addition to providing a pragmatic diagnostic, this work will hopefully begin a dialogue within the community about the robust application of deep learning to experimental analyses.},

In particular, in identification of physics objects, such as jet flavor tagging, complex neural network architectures play a major role. However, these methods are reliant on accurate simulations. Mismodeling can lead to non-negligible differences in performance in data that need to be measured and calibrated against. We investigate the classifier response to input data with injected mismodelings and probe the vulnerability of flavor tagging algorithms via application of adversarial attacks. Subsequently, we present an adversarial training strategy that mitigates the impact of such simulated attacks and improves the classifier robustness.

However, achieving a fine energy resolution in large-scale detectors is challenging. In this work, we present machine learning methods for energy reconstruction in the JUNO detector, the most advanced of its type. We focus on positron events in the energy range of 0-10 MeV which corresponds to the main signal in JUNO -- neutrinos originated from nuclear reactor cores and detected via the inverse beta decay channel. We consider the following models: Boosted Decision Trees and Fully Connected Deep Neural Network, trained on aggregated features, calculated using the information collected by PMTs. We describe the details of our feature engineering procedure and show that machine learning models can provide the energy resolution $\sigma = 3\%$ at 1 MeV using subsets of engineered features.

	abstract = {The Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO) is a multi-purpose neutrino experiment. One of the main goals is to determine the neutrino mass ordering by precisely measuring the energy spectrum of reactor antineutrinos. For reactor antineutrino detection, cosmogenic backgrounds such as $^9$Li/$^8$He and fast neutrons induced by cosmic muons should be rejected carefully by applying muon veto cuts, which requires good muon track reconstruction. With a 20$sim$kton liquid scintillator detector, simulation shows the proportion of muon bundles to be around 8\% in the JUNO, while its reconstruction is rarely discussed in previous experiments. According to the charge response of the PMT array, this paper proposes an efficient algorithm for muon bundle track reconstruction. This is the first reconstruction of muon bundles in a large volume liquid scintillator detector. Additionally, the algorithm shows good performance and potential in reconstruction for both single muon and double muons. The spatial resolution of single muon reconstruction is 20$sim$cm and the angular resolution is $0.5^\circ$. As for double muon reconstruction, the spatial resolution and angular resolution could be 30$sim$cm and $1.0^\circ$, respectively. Moreover, this paper has also discussed muon classification and veto strategy.},

The concentrations of the fluor, PPO, and the wavelength shifter, bis-{MSB}, were increased in 12 steps from 0.5 g/L and {\textless}0.01 mg/L to 4 g/L and 13 mg/L, respectively. The numbers of total detected photoelectrons suggest that, with the optically purified solvent, the bis-{MSB} concentration does not need to be more than 4 mg/L. To bridge the one order of magnitude in the detector size difference between Daya Bay and JUNO, the Daya Bay data were used to tune the parameters of a newly developed optical model. Then, the model and tuned parameters were used in the JUNO simulation. This enabled to determine the optimal composition for the JUNO LS: purified solvent LAB with 2.5 g/L PPO, and 1 to 4 mg/L bis-{MSB}.},

	abstract = {The Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO), a 20 kton multi-purpose underground liquid scintillator detector, was proposed with the determination of the neutrino mass hierarchy as a primary physics goal. It is also capable of observing neutrinos from terrestrial and extra-terrestrial sources, including supernova burst neutrinos, diffuse supernova neutrino background, geoneutrinos, atmospheric neutrinos, solar neutrinos, as well as exotic searches such as nucleon decays, dark matter, sterile neutrinos, etc. We present the physics motivations and the anticipated performance of the JUNO detector for various proposed measurements. By detecting reactor antineutrinos from two power plants at 53-km distance, JUNO will determine the neutrino mass hierarchy at a 3-4 sigma significance with six years of running. The measurement of antineutrino spectrum will also lead to the precise determination of three out of the six oscillation parameters to an accuracy of better than 1\%. Neutrino burst from a typical core-collapse supernova at 10 kpc would lead to $sim$5000 inverse-beta-decay events and $sim$2000 all-flavor neutrino-proton elastic scattering events in JUNO. Detection of DSNB would provide valuable information on the cosmic star-formation rate and the average core-collapsed neutrino energy spectrum. Geo-neutrinos can be detected in JUNO with a rate of $sim$400 events per year, significantly improving the statistics of existing geoneutrino samples. The JUNO detector is sensitive to several exotic searches, e.g. proton decay via the $p\to K^++\bar\nu$ decay channel. The JUNO detector will provide a unique facility to address many outstanding crucial questions in particle and astrophysics. It holds the great potential for further advancing our quest to understanding the fundamental properties of neutrinos, one of the building blocks of our Universe.},

	abstract = {Liquid scintillators are commonly used to detect low energy neutrinos from the reactors, sun, and earth. It is a challenge to reconstruct deposited energies for a large liquid scintillator detector. For detectors with multiple optical mediums such as JUNO and SNO+, the prediction of the propagation of detected photons is extremely difficult due to mixed optical processes such as Rayleigh scattering, refraction and total reflection at their boundaries. Calibration based reconstruction methods consume impractical time since a large number of calibration points are required in a giant detector. In this paper, we propose a new model-independent method to reconstruct deposited energies with minimum requirements on the calibration system. This method is validated with JUNO's offline software. Monte Carlo studies show that the energy non-uniformity can be controlled below 1\%, which is crucial for JUNO to achieve 3\% energy resolution.},

The rate of cosmic muons reaching the JUNO detector is about 3$sim$Hz and the muon induced neutrons and isotopes are major backgrounds for the neutrino detection. Reconstruction of the muon trajectory in the detector is crucial for the study and rejection of those backgrounds. This paper will introduce the muon tracking algorithm in the JUNO CD, with a least squares method of PMTs' first hit time (FHT). Correction of the FHT for each PMT was found to be important to reduce the reconstruction bias. The spatial resolution and angular resolution are better than 3$sim$cm and 0.4$sim$degree, respectively, and the tracking efficiency is greater than 90\% up to 16$sim$m far from the detector center.},

Event vertex and event time are not only useful for event selection but also essential for the reconstruction of event energy. In this study, four event vertex and event time reconstruction algorithms using charge and time information collected by photomultiplier tubes were analyzed comprehensively. The effects of photomultiplier tube properties were also investigated. The results indicate that the transit time spread is the main effect degrading the vertex reconstruction, while the effect of dark noise is limited. In addition, when the event is close to the detector boundary, the charge information provides better performance for vertex reconstruction than the time information.},

	abstract = {The Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO) is proposed to determine the neutrino mass hierarchy using an underground liquid scintillator detector. It is located 53 km away from both Yangjiang and Taishan Nuclear Power Plants in Guangdong, China. The experimental hall, spanning more than 50 meters, is under a granite mountain of over 700 m overburden. Within six years of running, the detection of reactor antineutrinos can resolve the neutrino mass hierarchy at a confidence level of 3-4$\sigma$, and determine neutrino oscillation parameters $\sin^2\theta_{12}$, $\Delta m^2_{21}$, and ${\textbar}\Delta m^2_{ee}{\textbar}$ to an accuracy of better than 1\%. The JUNO detector can be also used to study terrestrial and extra-terrestrial neutrinos and new physics beyond the Standard Model. The central detector contains 20,000 tons liquid scintillator with an acrylic sphere of 35 m in diameter. $\sim$17,000 508-mm diameter PMTs with high quantum efficiency provide $\sim$75\% optical coverage. The current choice of the liquid scintillator is: linear alkyl benzene (LAB) as the solvent, plus PPO as the scintillation fluor and a wavelength-shifter (Bis-{MSB}). The number of detected photoelectrons per MeV is larger than 1,100 and the energy resolution is expected to be 3\% at 1 MeV. The calibration system is designed to deploy multiple sources to cover the entire energy range of reactor antineutrinos, and to achieve a full-volume position coverage inside the detector. The veto system is used for muon detection, muon induced background study and reduction. It consists of a Water Cherenkov detector and a Top Tracker system. The readout system, the detector control system and the offline system insure efficient and stable data acquisition and processing.},

Originally developed to address the data processing and analysis needs of the present generation of cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments (e.g. BOOMERanG, WMAP), HEALPix can be expanded to meet many of the profound challenges that will arise in confrontation with the observational output of future missions and experiments, including e.g. Planck, Herschel, SAFIR, and the Beyond Einstein CMB polarization probe. In this paper we consider the requirements and constraints to be met in order to implement a sufficient framework for the efficient discretization and fast analysis/synthesis of functions defined on the sphere, and summarise how they are satisfied by HEALPix.},

	abstract = {JUNO is a multi-purpose neutrino observatory under construction in the south of China. This publication presents new sensitivity estimates for the measurement of the $\Delta m^2_{31}$, $\Delta m^2_{21}$, $\sin^2 \theta_{12}$, and $\sin^2 \theta_{13}$ oscillation parameters using reactor antineutrinos, which is one of the primary physics goals of the experiment. The sensitivities are obtained using the best knowledge available to date on the location and overburden of the experimental site, the nuclear reactors in the surrounding area and beyond, the detector response uncertainties, and the reactor antineutrino spectral shape constraints expected from the TAO satellite detector. It is found that the $\Delta m^2_{31}$, $\Delta m^2_{21}$, and $\sin^2 \theta_{12}$ oscillation parameters will be determined to better than 0.5\% precision in six years of data collection, which represents approximately an order of magnitude improvement over existing constraints.},

	abstract = {The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks in an encoder-decoder configuration. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.},

These algorithms, called REINFORCE algorithms, are shown to make weight adjustments in a direction that lies along the gradient of expected reinforcement in both immediate-reinforcement tasks and certain limited forms of delayed-reinforcement tasks, and they do this without explicitly computing gradient estimates or even storing information from which such estimates could be computed. Specific examples of such algorithms are presented, some of which bear a close relationship to certain existing algorithms while others are novel but potentially interesting in their own right. Also given are results that show how such algorithms can be naturally integrated with backpropagation. We close with a brief discussion of a number of additional issues surrounding the use of such algorithms, including what is known about their limiting behaviors as well as further considerations that might be used to help develop similar but potentially more powerful reinforcement learning algorithms.},

	abstract = {It is generally believed that neutrino mass hierarchy can be determined at a long baseline experiment, often using accelerator neutrino beams. Reactor neutrino experiments at an intermediate baseline have the capability to distinguish normal or inverted hierarchy. Recently it has been demonstrated that the mass hierarchy could possibly be identified using Fourier transform to the L/E spectrum if the mixing angle $\sin^2(2\theta_{13}){\textgreater}0.02$. In this study a more sensitive Fourier analysis is introduced. We found that an ideal detector at an intermediate baseline ($\sim 60$ km) could identify the mass hierarchy for a mixing angle $\sin^2(2\theta_{13}) {\textgreater} 0.005$, without requirements on accurate information of reactor neutrino spectra and the value of $\Delta m^2_{32}$.},

	abstract = {The Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO) is a 20 kton LS detector at 700-m underground. An excellent energy resolution and a large fiducial volume offer exciting opportunities for addressing many important topics in neutrino and astro-particle physics. With 6 years of data, the neutrino mass ordering can be determined at 3-4 sigma and three oscillation parameters can be measured to a precision of 0.6\% or better by detecting reactor antineutrinos. With 10 years of data, DSNB could be observed at 3-sigma; a lower limit of the proton lifetime of 8.34e33 years (90\% C.L.) can be set by searching for p-{\textgreater}nu_bar K^+; detection of solar neutrinos would shed new light on the solar metallicity problem and examine the vacuum-matter transition region. A core-collapse supernova at 10 kpc would lead to $sim$5000 IBD and $sim$2000 (300) all-flavor neutrino-proton (electron) scattering events. Geo-neutrinos can be detected with a rate of $sim$400 events/year. We also summarize the final design of the JUNO detector and the key R\&D achievements. All 20-inch PMTs have been tested. The average photon detection efficiency is 28.9\% for the 15,000 MCP PMTs and 28.1\% for the 5,000 dynode PMTs, higher than the JUNO requirement of 27\%. Together with the {\textgreater}20 m attenuation length of LS, we expect a yield of 1345 p.e. per MeV and an effective energy resolution of 3.02\%/\sqrt{E (MeV)}$ in simulations. The underwater electronics is designed to have a loss rate {\textless}0.5\% in 6 years. With degassing membranes and a micro-bubble system, the radon concentration in the 35-kton water pool could be lowered to {\textless}10 mBq/m^3. Acrylic panels of radiopurity {\textless}0.5 ppt U/Th are produced. The 20-kton LS will be purified onsite. Singles in the fiducial volume can be controlled to $sim$10 Hz. The JUNO experiment also features a double calorimeter system with 25,600 3-inch PMTs, a LS testing facility OSIRIS, and a near detector TAO.},

Monte Carlo simulation plays an important role for JUNO detector design, detector commissioning, offline data processing, and physics processing. The JUNO experiment has the world's largest liquid scintillator detector instrumented with many thousands of PMTs. The broad energy range of interest, long lifetime, and the large scale present data processing challenges across all areas. This paper describes the JUNO simulation software, highlighting the challenges of JUNO simulation and solutions to meet these challenges, including such issues as support for time-correlated analysis, event mixing, event correlation and handling the simulation of many millions of optical photons.},

	abstract = {We have carefully examined, in both analytical and numerical ways, how small the terrestrial matter effects can be in a given medium-baseline reactor antineutrino oscillation experiment like JUNO or RENO-50. Taking the ongoing JUNO experiment for example, we show that the inclusion of terrestrial matter effects may reduce the sensitivity of the neutrino mass ordering measurement by \Delta \chi^2_{\rm MO} \simeq 0.6, and a neglect of such effects may shift the best-fit values of the flavor mixing angle \theta_{12} and the neutrino mass-squared difference \Delta_{21} by about 1\sigma to 2\sigma in the future data analysis. In addition, a preliminary estimate indicates that a 2\sigma sensitivity of establishing the terrestrial matter effects can be achieved for about 10 years of data taking at JUNO with the help of a proper near detector implementation.},

	abstract = {Data-driven methods are widely used to overcome shortcomings of Monte Carlo simulations (lack of statistics, mismodeling of processes, etc.) in experimental high energy physics. A precise description of background processes is crucial to reach the optimal sensitivity for a measurement. However, the selection of the control region used to describe the background process in a region of interest biases the distribution of some physics observables, rendering the use of such observables impossible in a physics analysis. Rather than discarding these events and/or observables, we propose a novel method to generate physics objects compatible with the region of interest and properly describing the correlations with the rest of the event properties. We use a generative adversarial network (GAN) for this task, as GANs are among the best generator models for various applications. We illustrate the method by generating a new misidentiﬁed photon for the γ + jets background of the H → γγ analysis at the CERN LHC, and demonstrate that this GAN generator is able to produce a coherent object correlated with the diﬀerent properties of the rest of the event.},

	abstract = {This article presents the potential of a combined analysis of the JUNO and KM3NeT/{ORCA} experiments to determine the neutrino mass ordering. This combination is particularly interesting as it significantly boosts the potential of either detector, beyond simply adding their neutrino mass ordering sensitivities, by removing a degeneracy in the determination of $\Delta m_{31}^2$ between the two experiments when assuming the wrong ordering. The study is based on the latest projected performances for JUNO, and on simulation tools using a full Monte Carlo approach to the KM3NeT/{ORCA} response with a careful assessment of its energy systematics. From this analysis, a $5\sigma$ determination of the neutrino mass ordering is expected after 6 years of joint data taking for any value of the oscillation parameters. This sensitivity would be achieved after only 2 years of joint data taking assuming the current global best-fit values for those parameters for normal ordering.},

	abstract = {The Review summarizes much of particle physics and cosmology. Using data from previous editions, plus 3,324 new measurements from 878 papers, we list, evaluate, and average measured properties of gauge bosons and the recently discovered Higgs boson, leptons, quarks, mesons, and baryons. We summarize searches for hypothetical particles such as supersymmetric particles, heavy bosons, axions, dark photons, etc. Particle properties and search limits are listed in Summary Tables. We give numerous tables, figures, formulae, and reviews of topics such as Higgs Boson Physics, Supersymmetry, Grand Unified Theories, Neutrino Mixing, Dark Energy, Dark Matter, Cosmology, Particle Detectors, Colliders, Probability and Statistics. Among the 120 reviews are many that are new or heavily revised, including a new review on High Energy Soft QCD and Diffraction and one on the Determination of CKM Angles from B Hadrons.The Review is divided into two volumes. Volume 1 includes the Summary Tables and 98 review articles. Volume 2 consists of the Particle Listings and contains also 22 reviews that address specific aspects of the data presented in the Listings.The complete Review (both volumes) is published online on the website of the Particle Data Group (pdg.lbl.gov) and in a journal. Volume 1 is available in print as the PDG Book. A Particle Physics Booklet with the Summary Tables and essential tables, figures, and equations from selected review articles is available in print and as a web version optimized for use on phones as well as an Android app.},

In particular, we try to estimate the associated theory errors and find that induced currents like weak magnetism may ultimately limit our ability to improve the current accuracy and under certain circumstance could even largely increase the theoretical errors. We also perform a critical evaluation of the errors associated with our method to extract the anti-neutrino spectrum using synthetic beta spectra. It turns out, that a fit using only virtual beta branches with a judicious choice of the effective nuclear charge provides results with a minimal bias. We apply this method to actual data for U235, Pu239 and Pu241 and confirm, within errors, recent results, which indicate a net 3\% upward shift in energy averaged anti-neutrino fluxes. However, we also find significant shape differences which can in principle be tested by high statistics anti-neutrino data samples.},

	abstract = {We report new calculations of reactor antineutrino spectra including the latest information from nuclear databases and a detailed error budget. The first part of this work is the so-called ab initio approach where the total antineutrino spectrum is built from the sum of all beta-branches of all fission products predicted by an evolution code. Systematic effects and missing information in nuclear databases lead to final relative uncertainties in the 10 to 20\% range. A prediction of the antineutrino spectrum associated with the fission of 238U is given based on this ab initio method. For the dominant isotopes 235U and 239Pu, we developed a more accurate approach combining information from nuclear databases and reference electron spectra associated with the fission of 235U, 239Pu and 241Pu, measured at ILL in the 80's. We show how the anchor point of the measured total beta-spectra can be used to suppress the uncertainty in nuclear databases while taking advantage of all the information they contain. We provide new reference antineutrino spectra for 235U, 239Pu and 241Pu isotopes in the 2-8 MeV range. While the shapes of the spectra and their uncertainties are comparable to that of the previous analysis of the ILL data, the normalization is shifted by about +3\% on average. In the perspective of the re-analysis of past experiments and direct use of these results by upcoming oscillation experiments, we discuss the various sources of errors and their correlations as well as the corrections induced by off equilibrium effects.},

Located near the Taishan-1 reactor, TAO independently measures the antineutrino energy spectrum of the reactor with unprecedented energy resolution. The TAO experiment will realize a neutrino detection rate of about 2000 per day. In order to achieve its goals, TAO is relying on cutting-edge technology, both in photosensor and liquid scintillator (LS) development which is expected to have an impact on future neutrino and Dark Matter detectors. In this paper, the design of the TAO detector with a special focus on calorimetry is discussed.

A ton-level liquid scintillator detector will be placed at about 30 m from a core of the Taishan Nuclear Power Plant. The reactor antineutrino spectrum will be measured with sub-percent energy resolution, to provide a reference spectrum for future reactor neutrino experiments, and to provide a benchmark measurement to test nuclear databases. A spherical acrylic vessel containing 2.8 ton gadolinium-doped liquid scintillator will be viewed by 10 m^2 Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs) of {\textgreater}50\% photon detection efficiency with almost full coverage. The photoelectron yield is about 4500 per MeV, an order higher than any existing large-scale liquid scintillator detectors. The detector operates at -50 degree C to lower the dark noise of SiPMs to an acceptable level. The detector will measure about 2000 reactor antineutrinos per day, and is designed to be well shielded from cosmogenic backgrounds and ambient radioactivities to have about 10\% background-to-signal ratio. The experiment is expected to start operation in 2022.},

A discrepancy with the $\beta$ spectra measured at Institut Laue-Langevin (ILL) was observed, indicating a steady excess of the ILL ratio by the factor of $1.054\pm0.002$. We find a value of the ratio between inverse beta decay cross section per fission for $^{235}$U and $^{239}$Pu: $(^5\sigma_f/^9\sigma_f)_{KI} = 1.45 \pm 0.03$, and then we reevaluate the converted antineutrino spectra for $^{235}$U and $^{238}$U. We conclude that the new predictions are consistent with the results of Daya Bay and STEREO experiments.},

	abstract = {Recently new reactor antineutrino spectra have been provided for 235U, 239Pu, 241Pu and 238U, increasing the mean flux by about 3 percent. To good approximation, this reevaluation applies to all reactor neutrino experiments. The synthesis of published experiments at reactor-detector distances {\textless}100 m leads to a ratio of observed event rate to predicted rate of 0.976(0.024). With our new flux evaluation, this ratio shifts to 0.943(0.023), leading to a deviation from unity at 98.6\% C.L. which we call the reactor antineutrino anomaly. The compatibility of our results with the existence of a fourth non-standard neutrino state driving neutrino oscillations at short distances is discussed. The combined analysis of reactor data, gallium solar neutrino calibration experiments, and MiniBooNE-neutrino data disfavors the no-oscillation hypothesis at 99.8\% C.L. The oscillation parameters are such that {\textbar}Delta m_{new}^2{\textbar}{\textgreater}1.5 eV^2 (95\%) and sin^2(2\theta_{new})=0.14(0.08) (95\%). Constraints on the theta13 neutrino mixing angle are revised.},

	abstract = {Liquid scintillator (LS) is widely used in various neutrino oscillation experiments, in particular, the reactor neutrino experiments. The complex absorption and re-emission processes of optical photons are known to be an important source of the non-linear and non-uniform response of LS detectors. Precise simulation of light propagation in LS is highly desirable to model the detector response and reduce the systematic errors. In this paper, we develop a novel optical model which can completely deal with the competitive photon absorption and subsequent re-emission processes of the LS components. It allows to directly plug in the laboratory measurements of the LS components to model any LS composition. Extensive measurements have been performed to obtain the essential optical parameters for this model. We validate the model with a bench-top experiment featuring a small LS volume. Furthermore, we demonstrate that for any given detector geometry, this model provides the capability of optimizing the LS recipe to maximize the light collection. It is valuable for designing future LS-based detectors and improving the agreement between Monte Carlo and data for current neutrino experiments.},

This text covers the study of the scintillation process, which is concerned with the interactions of radiation and matter; the design of the scintillation counter; and the wide range of applications of scintillation counters in pure and applied science. The book is easy to read despite the complex nature of the subject it attempts to discuss. It is organized such that the first five chapters illustrate the fundamental concepts of scintillation counting. Chapters 6 to 10 detail the properties and applications of organic scintillators, while the next four chapters discuss inorganic scintillators. The last two chapters provide a review of some outstanding problems and a postscript. Nuclear physicists, radiation technologists, and postgraduate students of nuclear physics will find the book a good reference material.},

The mass production began in 2018 and elapsed for about 2 years at a rate of $\sim$1,000$sim${PMTs} per month. The characterization of the PMTs was performed in the factory concurrently with production as a joint effort between HZC and JUNO. Fifteen performance parameters were tracked at different sampling rates, and novel working strategies were implemented to improve quality assurance. This constitutes the largest sample of 3-inch PMTs ever produced and studied in detail to date.},

	abstract = {Main goal of the JUNO experiment is to determine the neutrino mass ordering using a 20kt liquid-scintillator detector. Its key feature is an excellent energy resolution of at least 3 \% at 1 MeV, for which its instruments need to meet a certain quality and thus have to be fully characterized. More than 20,000 20-inch PMTs have been received and assessed by JUNO after a detailed testing program which began in 2017 and elapsed for about four years. Based on this mass characterization and a set of specific requirements, a good quality of all accepted PMTs could be ascertained. This paper presents the performed testing procedure with the designed testing systems as well as the statistical characteristics of all 20-inch PMTs intended to be used in the JUNO experiment, covering more than fifteen performance parameters including the photocathode uniformity. This constitutes the largest sample of 20-inch PMTs ever produced and studied in detail to date, i.e. 15,000 of the newly developed 20-inch MCP-{PMTs} from Northern Night Vision Technology Co. (NNVT) and 5,000 of dynode PMTs from Hamamatsu Photonics K. K.(HPK).},

Certain sequences of bytes, most starting with an ASCII escape character and a bracket character, are embedded into text.  The terminal interprets these sequences as commands, rather than text to display verbatim.
{ANSI} sequences were introduced in the 1970s to replace vendor-specific sequences and became widespread in the computer equipment market by the early 1980s. They are used in development, scientific, commercial text-based applications as well as bulletin board systems to offer standardized functionality.
Although hardware text terminals have become increasingly rare in the 21st century, the relevance of the ANSI standard persists because a great majority of terminal emulators and command consoles interpret at least a portion of the ANSI standard.},

	abstract = {The JUNO (Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory) is a multipurpose neutrino experiment which is designed to determine neutrino mass hierarchy and precisely measure oscillation parameters. As one of the important systems, the JUNO offline software is being developed using the SNiPER software. In this proceeding, we focus on the requirements of JUNO simulation and present the working solution based on the SNiPER. The JUNO simulation framework is in charge of managing event data, detector geometries and materials, physics processes, simulation truth information etc. It glues physics generator, detector simulation and electronics simulation modules together to achieve a full simulation chain. In the implementation of the framework, many attractive characteristics of the SNiPER have been used, such as dynamic loading, flexible flow control, multiple event management and Python binding. Furthermore, additional efforts have been made to make both detector and electronics simulation flexible enough to accommodate and optimize different detector designs. For the Geant4-based detector simulation, each sub-detector component is implemented as a SNiPER tool which is a dynamically loadable and configurable plugin. So it is possible to select the detector configuration at runtime. The framework provides the event loop to drive the detector simulation and interacts with the Geant4 which is implemented as a passive service. All levels of user actions are wrapped into different customizable tools, so that user functions can be easily extended by just adding new tools. The electronics simulation has been implemented by following an event driven scheme. The SNiPER task component is used to simulate data processing steps in the electronics modules. The electronics and trigger are synchronized by triggered events containing possible physics signals. The JUNO simulation software has been released and is being used by the JUNO collaboration to do detector design optimization, event reconstruction algorithm development and physics sensitivity studies.},

	abstract = {A new search for the diffuse supernova neutrino background (DSNB) flux has been conducted at Super-Kamiokande (SK), with a $22.5\times2970$-kton$\cdot$day exposure from its fourth operational phase IV. The new analysis improves on the existing background reduction techniques and systematic uncertainties and takes advantage of an improved neutron tagging algorithm to lower the energy threshold compared to the previous phases of SK. This allows for setting the world's most stringent upper limit on the extraterrestrial $\bar{\nu}_e$ flux, for neutrino energies below 31.3 MeV. The SK-{IV} results are combined with the ones from the first three phases of SK to perform a joint analysis using $22.5\times5823$ kton$\cdot$days of data. This analysis has the world's best sensitivity to the DSNB $\bar{\nu}_e$ flux, comparable to the predictions from various models. For neutrino energies larger than 17.3 MeV, the new combined $90\%$ C.L. upper limits on the DSNB $\bar{\nu}_e$ flux lie around $2.7$ cm$^{-2}$$\cdot$$\text{sec}^{-1}$, strongly disfavoring the most optimistic predictions. Finally, potentialities of the gadolinium phase of SK and the future Hyper-Kamiokande experiment are discussed.},

	abstract = {The OPERA neutrino oscillation experiment has been designed to prove the appearance of ντ in a nearly pure νμ beam (CNGS) produced at CERN and detected in the underground Hall C of the Gran Sasso Laboratory, 730 km away from the source. In OPERA, τ leptons resulting from the interaction of ντ are produced in target units called bricks made of nuclear emulsion films interleaved with lead plates. The OPERA target contains 150000 of such bricks, for a total mass of 1.25 kton, arranged into walls interleaved with plastic scintillator strips. The detector is split into two identical supermodules, each supermodule containing a target section followed by a magnetic spectrometer for momentum and charge measurement of penetrating particles. Real time information from the scintillators and the spectrometers provide the identification of the bricks where the neutrino interactions occurred. The candidate bricks are extracted from the walls and, after X-ray marking and an exposure to cosmic rays for alignment, their emulsion films are developed and sent to the emulsion scanning laboratories to perform the accurate scan of the event. In this paper, we review the design and construction of the detector and of its related infrastructures, and report on some technical performances of the various components. The construction of the detector started in 2003 and it was completed in Summer 2008. The experiment is presently in the data taking phase. The whole sequence of operations has proven to be successful, from triggering to brick selection, development, scanning and event analysis.},

	abstract = {It is challenging to achieve high precision energy resolution for large liquid scintillator detectors. Energy non-uniformity is one of the main obstacles. To surmount it, a calibration-data driven method was developed previously to reconstruct event energy in the JUNO experiment. In this paper, we investigated the choice of calibration sources thoroughly, optimized the calibration positions and corrected the residual detector azimuthal asymmetry. All these efforts lead to a reduction of the energy non-uniformity near the detector boundary, from about 0.64\% to 0.38\%. And within the fiducial volume of the detector it is improved from 0.3\% to 0.17\%. As a result the energy resolution could be further improved.},
