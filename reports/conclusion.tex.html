<div class="linenb">&nbsp;10</div><div class="codeline">The field of neutrino physics still has a lot of unanswered questions, namely the mass of the mass states, the Neutrino Mass Ordering (NMO), the possible existence of CP violation in the lepton sector, the unitarity of the PMNS oscillation matrix, and even the nature of the neutrino -- Dirac or Majorana -- is still unknown. To answer all of these questions, neutrino physics must advance into an era of precision measurements, of which JUNO will be a part.</div><div class="clear"></div>

The reactor anti-neutrinos will interact with the liquid scintillator via Inverse Beta Decay.

A key element allowing for such techniques is the Dual Calorimetry, consisting of two photo-multiplier systems-large (LPMT) and small (SPMT)-each with its own characteristics. These two systems provide, almost, independent energy measurements of the same event. The presence of both systems not only enhances energy reconstruction but also provides valuable cross-checks, ensuring a thorough understanding of the systematic effects influencing JUNO.</span></span></div><div class="clear"></div>

I also present the existing antineutrino reconstruction methods, with and without machine learning, which are an important point of comparison with the methods I developed during this thesis.

Dealing with such a quantity of data requires architectures that help the network to identify essential information and to converge toward the result.
